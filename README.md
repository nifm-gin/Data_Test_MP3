# Data_Test_MP3
MP3 Projects aimed to test our software available at https://github.com/nifm-gin/MP3


## Preclinical_Example_MP3_Project
Please find a MP3 project called Preclinical_Example_MP3_project which contains MRI data of 2 rats with tumor each rat imaged at 3 timepoints.
Those data where processed (A brain ROI was drawn and some masked maps were computed).
One rat has been processed thanks to our method of parametric maps described by Benjamin Lemasson [ref].
The pipeline that has been executed on this rat is available on the project, and can be easily reproduced on any rat.
